This report investigates what factors are relevant in placing in the top 3 positions in a heat and see if we
can create a classifier to predict future horse winnings. Using data from the Hong Kong Jockey Club we
were able to visualize and understand relationships between the predictors and the target variable, top 3.
A logit and random forest model were used to predict future horse winnings through a train and test split.
Unfortunately, neither model was able to score high enough in sensitivity for it to be considered valid. Since
the dataset spans a little over two years, further testing should be done on more years of data as well as
looking into other classifiers.
